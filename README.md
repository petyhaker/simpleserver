Learning NodeJS

The project was created in the context of the "Learning NodeJS by Building 10 Projects" at StackSkills (http://stackskills.com/).
This is the first project of this tutorial and the aim is to create a basic website. 
It features express, jade and bootstrap css.

The code is on bluemix and the website is here: http://sserver.mybluemix.net/

P.S. There is no direct link between the bluemix code and this repository.
